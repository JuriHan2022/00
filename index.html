      I am unsure if human slavery could end but I aspire it to end in its most
      basic forms. Perhaps a close future will come where a constrained
      nine-to-five job is alos considered slavery. I wonder how current
      sturcutres could have lasted so long with taking pe@ople's values in a
      much lower price. But are peole willing to put in thwork to make it
      happen?
